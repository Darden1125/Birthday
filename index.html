      "I love how thoughtfull you are! The way you notice when I'm quiet and ask me how I'm really feeling. How you remember my favorite things. How you know just how to take care of me in any moment. It's these things and more that are a constant reminder of your love. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love your goofiness. Your ability to make me laugh and just geek out with me. You're so funny and cute at the same time. The best combo! ‚ú®",
      "I love how you make me want to be better. Not because you want me to change, but because your love pushes me to grow. Your support is the most powerful motivation and I am so thankfull to have somebody who supports me through everything. üíó",
      "I love that even ordinary moments feel special with you. Not everyday is a trip to Disney World, but you still make every moment magical. üíñ",
      "I love being able to enjoy movies, shows, and video games with you. It's so cool that I can bring up Master Cheif and you don't have to ask me who that is lol. Even just watching you play games like Super Mario Sunshine is so fun and cute! Playing Mario Kart with you next to me! Constantly laughing while playing Fortnite with you and Logan! So much fun!",
      "I love the way you look at me. Your eyes are so beautiful and powerful. I get so flustered every time you look at me ü§≠.",
      "I love your artistic skills. You have an amazing talent and I love that you share it with me! Every little drawing that you would pass to me in the office, the hilarious Microsoft Paint creations, and the very first drawing you did for me! I will cherish all of these forever! I'm always blown away at the level of detail and effort that you put into your artwork. You are seriously so incredible!ü´∂",
      "I love how just being around you feels like everything slows down. I can find peace anywhere as long as you are by my side. Thank you for being my peace, my safe place, and the person who gives me comfort in every moment. You're presence is powerful. Thank you my love ü•∞",
      "I love your random mini crash outs on inanimate objects. If the washing machine stops working, I just know that you'll end up saying some crazy shit to it like it's a person who offended your entire family. I think it's hilarious and I almost die laughing every time you do it! üòÇ",
      "I love your cooking! There's nothing else like it. You have not made one thing I didn't enjoy! Also, you don't just make the food. You do it with so much excitement and love. I can see how much you enjoy taking care of me and I am beyond grateful for everything single early morning breakfast, dinner, snack, packed lunch, dessert, and so much more! When you left for your trip, you left me with a week's worth of lunch and dinner. When you left Germany, you left me with a week's worth of dinner. The time, effort, love, and care you put into taking care of me does not go unnoticed. Thank you for taking care of me and making the most banging food I've ever had! You really are the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love how excited you get when you introduce me to new things. Movie I've never seen, food I've never tried, game I've never played, or a city I've never explored. These new experiences are special because your the one who's sharing it with me. Every shared experience is a new memory that I will cherish forever! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
      "I love how you love animals. Pets have always been a very big part of my life and I love that we share that experience. We see our pets as family and they really mean the world to us. You also introduced me to the coolest cats I have ever seen! It's just so great knowing that whatever pet(s) we add to our family in the future, they will be loved and adored by both of us!",
      "I love how we are on the same wavelength. I cannot tell you how many times you've literally read my mind! you finish my thoughts, say what i‚Äôm about to say, or just understand what I mean without me having to explain it. It's scary sometimes but I love it üòÇ!",
      "I love your sense of humor! Your delivery and timing are perfect! Sometimes you catch me off guard with a very witty joke and I just fall in love all over again üòÇ. I love those moments when we're on a roll making jokes back to back feeding off each other! Laughing with you is the best!‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love your style. Everything from your hair, what you like to wear, your tattoos, jewelry, the music you love, and how you decorate your home. I‚Äôm so drawn to everything about you. You make everything look good so easily. Every little detail is just so cool, cute, and charming!üòä",
      "I love how clean you are! You take such good care of yourself and everything around you. You pay attention to every little detail, and it really shows. You respect yourself and the space around you, and that‚Äôs rare. You‚Äôre so well put together in every way, and I notice that part of you every single day!‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love how comfortable we are together! We can be goofy and serious. We can laugh and cry together. We can play games and blow ass. All with a smile. All with pure love in our hearts. That's awesome!üòä",
      "I've talked about how much I love it when you go off on inanimate objects, but I also love it when you rage about people in public. There are some dumb ass people out there and it is so much more enjoyable having you next to me when someone is being an idiot. I love how we both are like, Did you see that shit? or when we simultaneously say Bruh. It can be a headache to experience this crazy world alone, but you turn it into a comedy and I would like to thank you for that! üòÇ",
      "I love how intelligent you are. Your ability to understand and see the bigger picture in everything. There's genuine thought behind your actions. You can think for yourself while still being open minded. You are very emotionally intelligent. Conversations with you are genuine and productive. You have an amazing head on your shoulders! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love how freaking cute you are! You smile at me. Cuteness overload. You wake me up in the morning. Cuteness overload. Fall asleep on my lap. Cuteness overload. Literally everything you do makes me want to squeeze something and explode! Rahhhh!üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love how genuine you are. You never fake a smile, put on an act, or change who you are for the sake of others. You are unapologetically you and that is so fucking awesome. That's a rare quality in this world!",
      "I love how we do everything together. There's nothing I can't imagine doing with you. Also being able to share our interests with each other is super cute. For example, I have never been into Anime but I love hearing what you like and I really enjoy you sharing that interest with me. I get to enjoy something new and I get to do it with you. I've never been able to share the love of pickled okra with someone before lol. Things like this are so cool to me. Being able to share pieces of our lives with each other no matter how insignificant they may seem is really special! ‚ù§Ô∏è",

      "I love how you give your all in taking care of others. Not everyday is easy or stress free, but you still find a way to be fully dedicated in making sure everybody is cared for. The amount of love and care Logan, the cats, and myself receive every day is just so pure. I'm simply amazed. I'm proud to call you my girlfriend and I'm ecstatic to call you my wife! ‚ù§Ô∏è",
      "I love how your hugs feel like the safest place in the world. The way you wrap your arms around me tell me that I am loved, and that you are always steady and full of love to give. I feel so grounded and at peace with you. No words even have to be spoken to understand how much we love each other. I could never take that for granted punkin. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
